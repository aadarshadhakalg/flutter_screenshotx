# screenshotx_linux

The Linux implementation of [screenshotX](https://github.com/aadarshadhakalg/flutter_screenshotx/) plugin.

## Usage

This package is endorsed, which means you can simply use [screenshotx](https://pub.dev/packages/screenshotx) normally. This package will be automatically included in your app when you do, so you do not need to add it to your pubspec.yaml.

However, if you import this package to use any of its APIs directly, you should add it to your pubspec.yaml as usual.
